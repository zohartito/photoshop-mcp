Photoshop tools (photoshop-mcp server)
=====================================

Session bootstrap
- Call \`photoshop_ping\` exactly once at the start of a session to verify the
  connection. Do not repeat it on every turn.
- Before suggesting AI-powered features (Generative Fill, Generative Upscale,
  Select Subject v2, neural filters, etc.), call \`photoshop_get_capabilities\`
  once to learn which features the user's installed Photoshop version exposes.

State before action
- Before any tool that needs an active document or active layer, call
  \`photoshop_get_state\` to confirm what is currently open. Treat its output as
  the source of truth for document dimensions, activeLayer, selection bounds and color
  mode.
- For visual confirmation after meaningful edits, call
  \`photoshop_get_preview\` (cheap, side-effect free JPEG snapshot). Use it
  sparingly — once per major step, not per atomic tool.

Recipe tools over atomic chains
- When the user's request matches a recipe purpose ("remove background",
  "cut out", "isolate subject", "enhance portrait", "smooth skin", "retouch",
  "prepare for web", "export Instagram variants", "apply cinematic color grade",
  "make it pop", "frequency separation", "replace mockup", "organize layers",
  "replace sky", "fade into background", "gradient mask", "dodge and burn",
  "remove that person", "erase distraction"), prefer the matching
  \`photoshop_recipe_*\` tool over composing 5+ atomic calls yourself. Recipes
  are wrapped in a single history step and are deterministically reversible
  with one undo.
- Drop back to atomic \`photoshop_*\` tools only for fine-grained, novel
  edits that no recipe covers.
- For teaching step-by-step mask/composite workflows, call \`prompts/get\` on
  a guide prompt (see Guide prompts below). Prefer the matching \`ps.*\`
  **recipe** prompt when the user wants a one-undo outcome.

Units & conventions
- All numeric coordinates, widths, heights and bounds are pixels. The server
  forces pixel/point units around every script — do not translate to inches/cm/percent.
- Font sizes are points. Colors are 0–255 RGB triplets.
- Output files default to \`~/.photoshop-mcp/exports[/<chat-id>]\`. Pass an absolute
  path only when the user explicitly asks for one.

Error recovery contract
- Tools return a structured envelope when something is wrong:
  \`{ ok: false, code, message, suggested_next_tool?, suggested_args?, context? }\`
  along with MCP's \`isError: true\`. When you see this, follow the
  \`suggested_next_tool\` hint instead of guessing or retrying blindly.
- Common codes you should be ready to handle without asking the user:
  - \`no_active_document\` — call \`photoshop_open_image\` or
    \`photoshop_create_document\` first.
  - \`no_active_layer\` / \`layer_not_found\` — list layers with
    \`photoshop_get_layers\`, then act on a specific name.
  - \`selection_required\` — make a selection before reusing the failed tool.
  - \`version_unsupported\` / \`generative_unavailable\` — degrade gracefully
    to a non-generative alternative; tell the user once which feature is
    missing.

Multi-step etiquette
- After every tool result, decide: continue with the next planned tool, or
  emit a short user-facing summary. Do not end a turn on a tool call when
  the user asked for an outcome.
- Group related atomic edits inside a recipe when possible. When you must
  chain atomics, name layers (\`photoshop_rename_layer\`) so future turns can
  re-target them deterministically.

User intent glossary
- Map colloquial phrases to the primary tool below.
- bg.remove — "remove background", "cut out", "isolate subject", "transparent
  background", "arka planı sil" → \`photoshop_recipe_remove_background\`
- obj.remove — "remove that person", "erase distraction", "generative remove"
  → \`photoshop_recipe_remove_distraction\` (content-aware; select region first);
  fallback \`photoshop_content_aware_fill\` after manual selection
- mask.gradient_fade — "fade into background", "gradient mask", "blend subject"
  → \`photoshop_recipe_gradient_fade\`; guide \`ps.gradient_blend\` for atomic chain
- sky.replace — "replace sky", "fix blown sky", "better clouds" →
  \`photoshop_recipe_sky_blend\`; guide \`ps.composite_blend\` for manual composite
- portrait.enhance — "smooth skin", "retouch portrait", "fix blemishes" →
  \`photoshop_recipe_enhance_portrait\`
- portrait.freq_sep — "frequency separation", "split texture and color" →
  \`photoshop_recipe_frequency_separation\`
- color.correct — "make it pop", "S-curve", "fix flat image", "auto tone" →
  \`photoshop_adjust_curves\`; fallback \`photoshop_auto_levels\` then
  \`photoshop_adjust_brightness_contrast\`; guide \`ps.color_correct\`
- color.grade — "cinematic", "teal orange", "moody grade" →
  \`photoshop_recipe_apply_color_grade\`
- light.dodge_burn — "dodge and burn", "sculpt light", "lighten face" →
  \`photoshop_recipe_dodge_burn\`; guide \`ps.dodge_burn_guide\` for atomic setup
- export.social — "for Instagram", "web export" →
  \`photoshop_recipe_export_social_variants\` or \`photoshop_recipe_prepare_for_web\`
- layers.organize — "organize layers", "rename mess" → \`photoshop_recipe_organize_layers\`

Degrade paths
- Generative remove / distraction — ideal \`photoshop_generative_remove\` is not
  available via ExtendScript. Degrade: user selects region →
  \`photoshop_recipe_remove_distraction\` or \`photoshop_content_aware_fill\` →
  ask user to refine manually.
- Sky replacement menu — ideal \`photoshop_sky_replacement\` is not scriptable.
  Degrade: \`photoshop_recipe_sky_blend\` when a sky file path is available;
  otherwise \`photoshop_place_image\` + \`photoshop_create_layer_mask\` +
  \`photoshop_apply_gradient_mask\` or guide \`ps.composite_blend\`.
- Select Subject v2 missing — \`photoshop_recipe_remove_background\` returns
  \`version_unsupported\` → manual selection tools + \`photoshop_create_layer_mask\`.
- Curves unavailable — use \`photoshop_auto_levels\` then
  \`photoshop_adjust_brightness_contrast\` before retrying stronger edits.

Disambiguation
- "gradient" — prefer linear gradient **on a layer mask** (blend/fade); not a
  Gradient Fill layer unless the user explicitly asks for a fill layer.
- "remove" — prefer mask or content-aware inpainting; not deleting the layer
  unless the user explicitly wants pixels destroyed.
- "sharpen" — web export sharpen pass → \`photoshop_recipe_prepare_for_web\`;
  single-layer sharpen → \`photoshop_apply_sharpen\`.

Guide prompts (MCP prompts/get)
- Prefer matching \`ps.*\` **recipe** prompt when the user wants a one-undo outcome;
  use guide prompts for teaching atomic chains.
- Recipe prompts (1:1 with \`photoshop_recipe_*\`): \`ps.remove_background\`,
  \`ps.enhance_portrait\`, \`ps.prepare_for_web\`, \`ps.export_social_variants\`,
  \`ps.apply_color_grade\`, \`ps.frequency_separation\`, \`ps.batch_mockup_replace\`,
  \`ps.organize_layers\`, \`ps.gradient_fade\`, \`ps.sky_blend\`, \`ps.dodge_burn\`,
  \`ps.remove_distraction\`
- Guide prompts (no recipe pair): \`ps.gradient_blend\` — fade via mask gradient;
  \`ps.color_correct\` — tone / contrast fix chain; \`ps.dodge_burn_guide\` — 50% gray
  overlay setup; \`ps.composite_blend\` — place asset + mask + blend mode
