# Development

Build, lint, and test the photoshop-mcp server locally.

← Back to [README](../README.md)

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp.git
cd photoshop-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Watch Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Lint & Format

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Integration tests (requires running Photoshop)

```bash
npm run build:server
npm run spike:issue-2     # issue #2 targeted regression (10 checks)
npm run test:mcp-local    # prompt-layer smoke
npm run test:mcp-all      # full sequential tool sweep
npm run spike:photoshop-actions  # generative AI action probes → scripts/output/generative-probe-report.json
npm run verify:photoshop-prompts
```

### UXP bridge plugin (Neural Filters)

Neural Filters (`photoshop_neural_filter`) require the companion plugin in `uxp-plugin/`:

1. Install [Adobe UXP Developer Tools](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/).
2. **Load Plugin** → select the `uxp-plugin/` folder in this repo.
3. Open the **MCP Bridge** panel in Photoshop (keeps polling the MCP server on `127.0.0.1:38452`).
4. Start `photoshop-mcp` or the web UI — the server starts the bridge HTTP listener automatically.

Override port with `PHOTOSHOP_UXP_BRIDGE_PORT` (default `38452`).

### Generative AI tools

Firefly tools (`photoshop_generative_*`, `photoshop_generate_image`, `photoshop_sky_replacement`) require:

- Photoshop 24+ (Generative Fill) or 27+ (Generative Upscale)
- Signed-in Adobe account with generative credits
- Optional live smoke: `PHOTOSHOP_AI_SMOKE=1 npm run test:mcp-all`

## Integration test results

Local MCP integration tests run against a live Photoshop instance over stdio
(same path as Cursor / Claude Desktop). Last verified on **Photoshop 26.5.0**
(macOS).

*Recorded on PS 26.5.0 (macOS) after issue #2 fixes and Phase 2 test harness — re-run `npm run test:mcp-all` to refresh.*

| Suite | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Issue #2 regression | `npm run spike:issue-2` | Targeted checks (metadata, layers, place, Smart Object transform, jsString escapes, fonts, alert, CJK names) |
| Full tool + recipe sweep | `npm run test:mcp-all` | **119 pass**, **0 fail**, **4 skip** (123 total) |
| Prompt-layer smoke | `npm run test:mcp-local` | 16 prompt templates + core recipes |
| Prompt ↔ recipe parity | `npm run verify:photoshop-prompts` | 12↔12 strict match + 4 guides |

**Tool coverage:** 80 total tools (68 atomic `photoshop_*` + 12 recipe
`photoshop_recipe_*`) — re-run `npm run test:mcp-all` for a fresh pass count.

**Intentional skips** (environment-dependent, not regressions):

| Tool | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `photoshop_play_action` | Requires a real Actions palette entry on the machine |
| `photoshop_select_subject` | Requires a recognizable subject in the active layer |
| `photoshop_recipe_remove_background` | Synthetic test canvas has no recognizable subject for Select Subject |
| `photoshop_recipe_batch_mockup_replace` | Requires a Smart Object mockup PSD |

**PS 26 compatibility notes** (ExtendScript): layer masks use `stringID make`;
mask apply uses `delete` + `apply: true`; hue/saturation uses `Hst2` descriptors;
frequency separation uses `applyImageEvent` calculation descriptors. See
[`src/api/extendscript.ts`](../src/api/extendscript.ts) and
[`src/tools/recipes/_shared.ts`](../src/tools/recipes/_shared.ts).

Prerequisites: Photoshop installed and scriptable; run from the repo root after
`npm run build:server`.

## Usage Examples

Prompt the AI assistant in natural language — the MCP server picks the right tools.

### Create a Simple Design

> Create an 800×600 RGB document, add a light blue background layer, center the text "My Design" at 64pt, then save as `design.psd` on the Desktop.

### Batch Process Images

> Open my image, resize to 1920×1080, save as a high-quality JPEG to the Desktop, then close without saving the PSD.

### Design with Stock Images (Pexels)

Combine with a [Pexels MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) if configured:

> Search Pexels for "nature landscape", place the downloaded photo in a 1920×1080 document, fit to fill the canvas, add "Beautiful Nature" as overlay text at the top, save as `nature-design.psd`.

## Quick Start Examples

### Common Use Cases

| Task | Prompt Example |
|------|----------------|
| **Basic Design** | "Create 1920x1080 document, add blue background, center text 'Hello'" |
| **Photo Edit** | "Open photo.jpg, apply auto levels, sharpen 100%, save as edited.jpg" |
| **Stock Image** | "Place image.jpg, fit to fill canvas, add overlay text 'Summer 2026'" |
| **Layer Effects** | "Set active layer blend mode to MULTIPLY, opacity 80%" |
| **Filters** | "Apply 10px Gaussian blur to current layer" |
| **Text Styling** | "Change text to Helvetica 64pt, color red, center aligned" |
| **Batch Work** | "Resize to 1080x1080, auto contrast, save as square.jpg, close" |
| **Masks** | "Select rectangle 100,100 to 500,500, create layer mask" |
| **Portrait recipe** | "Enhance portrait at medium intensity with skin smoothing, then preview" |
| **Background removal** | "Remove background from active layer, 2px feather, non-destructive mask" |
| **Web export** | "Prepare for web + export Instagram and X post variants to exports folder" |
| **Color grade** | "Apply warm_film color grade as adjustment layers" |
| **Frequency separation** | "Build FS stack at 6px — I'll paint the Low/High layers myself" |
| **State check** | "Ping Photoshop, get capabilities, then get_state before editing" |
